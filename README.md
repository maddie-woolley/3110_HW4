3110 Assignment 4 ReadMe File 

By Maddie Woolley

BFS and DFS are in seperate cpp files 

Input text file in hard coded in as "graph.txt" in both files, and can be changed if needed in line 97(BFS) or line 66(DFS)

Driver code reads in the input file into a 2D array, and iterates through into the upper section of the code. For the DFS this mainly utilizes map and 
for the BFS mainly utilizing a queue. Both of these have a boolean "visited" array.


Main code was adapted from Geeks for Geeks and edited to fit the input and output needs for this assignment
